This Wordle repository was an old project of mine back when I was taking AP Computer Science A in my high school.

This program is very basic and uses elementary Java knowledge I learnt over the course of the 2022-2023 school year.

I plan on revising this coding project frequently as I continue to learn more about coding here at the University of Washington. Hopefully this will look a lot better than what it is now!

LIST OF UPDATES:

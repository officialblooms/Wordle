## Wordle

My own version of a Wordle program I made back in high school in AP Computer Science A, and continue to improve and refine it as I learn more about coding while at the Univeristy of Washington. Hopefully this will look a lot better than what it is now!

## Installation

(probably wrong lol)
Clone the git repository onto your local machine by doing:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/officialblooms/Wordle/
```
After installing, run the folder in your code editor and run the program on ```main.java```, and have fun with the game!

## Updates
As I continue improving my high school project, I will document specific changes made on the client-side. Make sure you do ```git pull``` to ensure you are playing on the updated version!
- 3/27/24: Added specific instructions for user during Wordle play
- 3/29/24: Replaced output of word status from words into symbols (_, *, <letter>)
- 4/1/24: Combined games with same # attempts into one line
- 4/4/24: User can now choose how long word solution can be (from 4 to 8 letters); No longer need to include a banned words text file!
- 4/7/24: Word solution length can be from 3 to 6 letters now
- 4/17/24: Output now includes the word and clues from previous guesses as well for easier reference
- 4/22/24: Added hard mode where you are required to use hints gathered from previous guesses.
